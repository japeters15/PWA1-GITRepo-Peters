//1.Add the Person object to the global window object
       Example: "window.Person=Person;"

//Two variables, "jobs" and "actions"
//2.The jobs variable is an array of 4 or more jobs. The actions variable is also an array of some actions a person could do.
    ex: Person.jobs = ["teacher","farmer","student","pilot"];
    ex: Person.actions = ["sleeping","eating","working"];

//3.The Person constructor should also have four properties:
    //name: The name of the person. (This property is set in this constructor for the Person.)
    //action: for the Person. This property states what the person is actively doing and it is one of the values in the actions array.
    //Select one item from the Person.action array for this property (Math.random() method).
    //job: for the Person and is one of the values in the jobs array. ( Math.random() method).
    //row: like the name property, this is set in this constructor.

//4.Display the initial action of the person in 3rd column.
//5.The Person object must have an update() function added to its prototype. (called from the main.js file)
